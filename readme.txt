A basic theme build to test how easy it is to build a Gutenberg ready theme.

== Description ==
Blockz is a theme build to be ready for Gutenberg. Uses TailwindCSS as a componentized style framework.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't a certain block look right or why isn't it styled =

If a block looks broken or doesn't work correctly please let me know.

Some blocks are completely unstyled on purpose, I decided to try add the absolute minimum about of styles and rely as much as possible on the core provided block styling.

== Changelog ==

= 0.1.0 =
* Initial build

== Resources ==
* tailwindcss - used under MIT licence.
